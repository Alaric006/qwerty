# Overview

Profiling a qwerty program can be an involved task. Qwerty programs are started in Python, which calls JIT'd Rust code, descending through C++ and MLIR. There are no doubt other ways of approaching profiling, however, the approach described below we found to be the most versatile, providing good details throughout the language layers.


# Approach

This approach uses  py-spy, a python profiling program that drills well into C++ and Rust stacks. py-spy works by observing -- but not injecting itself into -- the program that it profiles. As most test programs finish quickly, and py-spy seems to have problems sampling at more than 25-50 Hz, it is necessary to run a sample program over many iterations. The result is not a profile of a single run, but the average of many. These results are great for providing an overview. That being said, if the goal is to obtain a high accuracy profile of particular segment occupying a small portion of total runtime, py-spy may not be the ideal choice.

# How to


## Install py-spy

Install py-spy using pip, making sure you are inside the qwerty venv:

```
pip install py-spy
```

## Create Test Script

Create a test python script:

 - Place the program you would like to sample in a for loop.
 - The number of iterations of the for loop depends on the desired granuality. For a rough overview, 50 iterations is sufficient. 500 or 5000 iterations is more suitable for detailed reports. Longer running programs may need lower numbers of iterations.
 - Place ``_reset_compiler_state()`` at the top of the loop body.

As an example, here is what a test script for [examples/bv.py](../examples/bv.py) might look like. Note that only the code in the body of ``if __name__ == 'main':`` has been changed:

**bv-sampler.py**
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
Perform the BernsteinΓÇöVazirani algorithm on a provided bitstring, printing the
bitstring determined by both the quantum algorithm and classical algorithm.
"""

from argparse import ArgumentParser
from qwerty import *
from qwerty.kernel import _reset_compiler_state

def bv(oracle, acc=None):
    @qpu[[N]]
    def kernel():
        return ('p'**N | oracle.sign
                       | pm**N >> std**N
                       | measure**N)

    return kernel(acc=acc)

def get_black_box(secret_string):
    @classical[[N]]
    def f(x: bit[N]) -> bit:
        return (secret_string & x).xor_reduce()
    return f

def naive_classical(f, n_bits):
    secret_found = bit[n_bits](0)
    x = bit[n_bits](0b1 << (n_bits-1))
    for i in range(n_bits):
        secret_found[i] = f(x)
        x = x >> 1
    return secret_found

# DIFFERENCE
if __name__ == '__main__':
	# Run 5000 samples of bv
    for i in range(0, 5000):
	    # IMPORTANT
        _reset_compiler_state()
        secret_str = bit.from_str("1000")
        n_bits = len(secret_str)
        black_box = get_black_box(secret_str)

        print('Classical:', naive_classical(black_box, n_bits))
        print('Quantum:  ', bv(black_box, acc=None))
```

``_reset_compiler_state()`` is needed due to an oversight with the current compiler. If this line is not placed, the compiler will crawl to a halt under the weight of unfreed internal resources. This is an issue that we plan to address in the future.

## Run Script
To begin sampling, run:

``py-spy record -o py-spy-results.prof --native --format speedscope -- python <my-sampler.py>``

``--native`` is essential so that py-spy accurately profiles C++ and Rust portions of the qwerty compiler.


## Visualizing with speedscope

Visit [https://www.speedscope.app/](https://www.speedscope.app/) and upload the .prof file created in the previous step.

Once the profile is uploaded, select "left heavy" in the top-left corner. The default organization will show every run one after the other. Selecting "leave heavy" consolidates function calls together. It is very important to select this mode as we are using a statistical approach.

If you face issues with using https://www.speedscope.app/, try running the program in Google Chrome.
